# Project Logbook – FPGA Distortion Pedal
-----

## Entry 1 — Project Start  
**Date:** Nov 21, 2025  
**Time:** 8:00 PM  

### Summary  
Started planning a real-time digital distortion pedal implemented on the Altera DE2-115 FPGA.  
Initial goal is to build audio passthrough using the WM8731 audio codec, then implement a simple distortion stage, and later add multiple presets.

### Work Completed
- Created github repo and folder structure ('src', 'test','docs').
- Added first readme
- Defined primary goal: digital distortion pedal running on fpga
- Created "high_level_design" to map-out current plans and goals for the project
- Using Lucidchart created a high level block diagram "block_diagram_fpga_distortion_pedal"
