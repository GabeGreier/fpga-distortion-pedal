# FPGA Distortion Pedal
This project is a simple real-time digital distortion effect implemented on the **Altera DE2-115 FPGA**.  
The goal is to take an audio signal, apply digital distortion, and output the processed signal.  

## Hardware Used
- Altera DE2-115 FPGA board  
- WM8731 audio codec (onboard)  
- Guitar or audio source  
- Preamp/DI box (ex: NUX MG300) for line-level input  
- 3.5mm line-in / line-out cables


## Notes
All development is done in **Verilog** using **Quartus**.  
Some of the codec implementation, aswell as lcd screen was written with AI. I take full responsibility for the code and use of AI in my projects.
